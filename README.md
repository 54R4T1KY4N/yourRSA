# yourRSA
This code is a magical lock and key system for secure communication! It generates a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, using math to ensure only the recipient can unlock it.

**HOW TO USE:**

    • To generate the pair of keys using this code, you'll need Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, there are no external packages required.
    
    • First, run the code to generate your public and private keys.

    • Share your public key with anyone you want to communicate with securely. This can be done through any communication channel you choose, such as email, messaging apps, or social media.

    • To send a secure message to someone, first, encrypt the message using their public key. You can do this using any encryption software that supports the RSA encryption algorithm, which is the same algorithm used by this code. One popular software is OpenSSL.

    • Once you have encrypted the message, send it to your recipient through your chosen communication channel.

    • Your recipient can then decrypt the message using their private key, which should be kept secret. They can use the same encryption software you used to encrypt the message, and provide their private key when prompted.

    • Once the message is decrypted, your recipient will be able to read it and respond securely by encrypting their own message with your public key.

    • You can decrypt their message using your private key, and continue the secure conversation.
    
    
**The system requirements to run this code are:**

    • A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
    • Python 3 installed on your computer
    • Enough free RAM to run the Python interpreter and the functions in the code, which shouldn't be too demanding
    • Enough CPU power to run the code efficiently, which shouldn't be too demanding either
    In general, any modern computer should be able to run this code without any issues.

**Remember, the security of your communication relies on keeping your private key secret, so make sure to keep it safe and secure!**
